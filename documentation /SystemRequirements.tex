% Document Purpose
\section{Document Purpose}
The purpose of this document is to outline the overall design, architecture, and ideas of our project and its requirements with respect to consumers. Our goal is to provide a clear understanding of our software product, its parameters, and the goal we wish to achieve.\\\\
In this document, we shall attempt to predict and sort out how we hope this product will be used in order to gain a better understanding of the project, outline concepts that will be developed, and document ideas that may be considered, but could also be discarded as the product develops. This document will also highlight the projectâ€™s target audience, predicted behaviour, constraints, as well as software requirements. 

\subsection{Scope}

\subsubsection{Project Purpose}
The purpose of our project is to provide our clients with an android application that can identify movies based on a set of video and audio input. The application will accept these parameters and return the movie title along with other metadata (cast, synopsis, genre, box office details, production company, etc) related to the film. 

\subsubsection{Goals}
\begin{table}[hbtp]
    \centering
    \begin{tabular}{|c|c|}
        \hline
         & GOALS (not in any particular order)\\
         \hline
         1 & Return a response within 10 seconds\\
         \hline
         2 & Process uploaded videos\\
         \hline
         3 & Recognize foreign films\\
         \hline
    \end{tabular}
    \caption{Project Goals}
\end{table}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Return a response within 10 seconds
    \begin{itemize}
        \item the application will respond after a video has been uploaded
        \item the response may be a list of movies within 10 seconds or a notification informing the user the processing is taking longer than expected
        \item each movie will include meta data and confidence percentages
    \end{itemize}
    
    \item process uploaded videos
    \begin{itemize}
        \item The application can record videos straight from the user's phone camera and be uploaded for processing
    \end{itemize}
    
    \item Recognize foreign films
    \begin{itemize}
        \item The movies recognized by the application extends beyond Hollywood films
        \item Chinese, Bollywood, Indie
    \end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Project Scope}
The scope of the project is to be able to identify movies from short video clips. The development team will be focusing on Hollywood movies. Users will be able to input a video clip and the system will give a list of movies with confidence percentages. The scope of the information that will be retrieved is meta data such as actors, release date and description.

\subsection{Intended Audience / Stakeholders}

\subsubsection{Intended Audience}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Mobile Device Users
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Stakeholders}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Dr. Alan Wassyng
    \item Nicholas Annable
    \item Curtis Milo
    \item Rohan Patel
    \item Tim Tomashevski
\end{itemize}

% \subsection{Intended Use}
% The application will be used in a casual setting. The user will open the application and record a video through the camera, After 10 seconds, a list of movies and the confidence level for each movie is displayed. Clicking on each movie will show the movie metadata.

% System Behaviour
\section{System Behaviour}

\subsection{Behaviour Overview}
The behaviour of the system acts like the diagram in section 4.2. The system waits for the input of user. If there is an valid input(video/audio), the video is being processed; else, the system asks for a valid input. Then, if the movie is identified, report to the user; else, tell the user that it is not identified.

    Idle & The system is open and ready to accept video input\\
    \hline
    Record Video & The user records a video using their mobile device.\\
    \hline
    Upload video & The application attempts to upload a video to the server for processing. A maximum of \hyperref[tab:Variables]{\textbf{UploadAttempts}} is allocated before considering the state a failure.\\
    \hline
    Video Processing & The video is processed by modules.\\
    \hline
    Return Result & The video has been processed and is either identified (success) or not identified (failed) and the execution of the system ends. The result is returned to the user.\\
    \hline
    \end{tabularx}
    \caption{Required Behaviour Description}
    \label{tab:States}
\end{table}

\subsection{Normal Behaviour}
Under normal operating conditions, the application shall be able to run on a mobile device that supports Android 10 (https://developer.android.com/about/versions/10/features). The application shall have access to the mobile devicesâ€™ camera and microphone hardware to have the ability to take image, video, and/or audio snippets. The mobile device will be connected to the internet for quick results. 

\subsection{Undesired Event Handling}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Application unexpectedly crashes during identification process/cell phone unexpectedly turns off
        \begin{itemize}
        \item The system will save the latest uploaded movie clip, so next time the user will not have to upload the clip again
        \item The system will automatically run a troubleshooting test to check the storage, memory usage, battery level the cell phone
        \end{itemize}
   \item Identification process takes too long due to weak internet signal or slow internet connection
        \begin{itemize}
        \item The system will notify the user about the internet latency and suggest the user to run the application under WIFI connection
        \end{itemize}
    \item Input clip length is too short to provide sufficient information for the application to identify the movie
        \begin{itemize}
        \item The system will notify the user to upload a longer clip, or film the video longer
        \end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}
